# frontend-learning 🌐

Hi there! 👋  
Welcome to my repository, where I’m systematically documenting my journey to become a **frontend developer**.

I’ve chosen the community-vetted [Frontend Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) as my guide. Following it step by step, I’m progressing from foundational web concepts all the way to modern tools, frameworks, and advanced practices.

Each topic I complete includes:
- ✍️ Theoretical notes  
- 💻 Hands-on coding exercises  
- 📈 Regular Git commits  
- 📂 Updated folder structure  

> 📌 Folders are created **only as I complete** each block of the roadmap — no jumping ahead!

## Why Frontend Development?

Frontend development is more than just writing code — it’s about **crafting user experiences**. For me, it’s also an ideal entry point into a tech career, specifically web development. Here’s why:

1. **Visible results** — you see the outcome of your work instantly. This keeps me motivated and accelerates learning, because progress is always in front of my eyes.

2. **No formal degree needed** — you don’t need a technical background, advanced math, or deep algorithm knowledge. Logical thinking, curiosity, and internet access are enough to begin.

3. **Abundant learning resources** — video tutorials, blogs, podcasts, communities, and open-source projects are everywhere. Help is always within reach.

4. **High market demand** — especially in small and medium businesses. Companies seek developers who can build interfaces and enhance user experience — and they’re ready to pay well for it.

> 💡 Salaries vary based on experience, specific skills (e.g., React, TypeScript, performance optimization), and company size — but consistent learning and a strong portfolio significantly boost earning potential.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

All content lives under [`topics/`](./topics/), mirroring the learning path from the roadmap:

New directories and projects will appear as I advance.

## 🤝 Feedback Welcome!

This is a **learning-focused** project — but if you spot an error, have a suggestion, or just want to say hello, feel free to open an issue or PR. Every bit of feedback helps me grow.
