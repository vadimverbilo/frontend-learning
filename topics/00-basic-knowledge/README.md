# Basic Knowledge

In this folder, I'll focus on skills that aren't directly related to coding, but which I believe are crucial for aspiring developers. Specifically:

- 🔍How to effectively search for information online, or, more simply, "how to Google it correctly";
- 💻 Working with the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) code editor – settings, extensions, hotkeys, and everyday practices;
- 🌐 Network and browser fundamentals, i.e., what happens "under the hood" when you open a page in a browser.

These topics form the invisible yet fundamental foundation for systematic and sustainable development in web development.
