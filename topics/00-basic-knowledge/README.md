# Basic Knowledge

## In this folder, I'll be focusing on skills that aren't directly related to coding, but that I believe are extremely important and useful for a beginning developer, including

- 🔍 How to effectively search for information online, or, more simply, "how to Google it correctly"
- 💻 Working with the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) code editor - settings, extensions, hotkeys, and everyday practices
- 🌐 Network and browser fundamentals - what happens "under the hood" when you open a page in a browser

💡These topics form for me, as a beginner, an invisible but fundamental basis for systematic and sustainable development in web development.
