# Basic Knowledge

This folder covers foundational non-code skills every frontend developer needs **before writing the first line of HTML**:

- 🧠 How to search effectively (Google operators)
- 💻 Working efficiently with VS Code
- 🌐 Understanding how the web works (HTTP, DNS, client-server model)

These topics form the invisible foundation of daily development work.
